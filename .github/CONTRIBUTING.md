## <span id="reporting-bugs">üí£ Reporting Bugs</span>

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating a new issue, **[Perform a cursory search](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/issues)** to see if the report exists. If it does, go through the discussion thread and leave a comment instead of opening a new one.

If you find a **Closed** issue that is the same as what you are experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original case in the body of your new one.

If you cannot find an open or closed issue addressing the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/issues).

Be sure to include a **clear title and description**, as much **relevant information** as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### <span id="good-bug-report"> How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?</span>

A good Bug Report should include the following:

- A clear and descriptive title for the bug report
- The exact steps to reproduce the bug
- The behavior you observed after following the steps
- The behavior you expected to see instead
- What might be causing the issue (if you have any idea)
- Screenshots or animated GIFs of the issue (if applicable)
- If you use the keyboard while following the steps, use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/byzanz) on Linux.

## <span id="suggesting-enhancements-and-features">üõ† Suggesting Enhancements/Features</span>

We track Enhancements and Feature Requests as GitHub issues.

Before submitting an enhancement/feature request, **[perform a cursory search](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/issues)** to see if the request exists. If it does, go through the conversation thread to see if there is additional information and contribute to the conversation instead of opening a new one.

If you find a **Closed** issue, go through the conversation thread to see if the feature has already been implemented or rejected. If not, you can open a new issue.

### <span id="good-feature-request">How Do I Submit A Good Feature Request?</span>

A good Feature Request should include the following:

- A clear and descriptive title of the request
- A detailed description of the request, including:
  - The problem you are trying to solve
  - How you are currently working around the lack of this feature
  - Any possible drawbacks of the feature
  - How the feature can be implemented
- An explanation of why this enhancement would be helpful to the project and the community
- Any links to resources or other projects that might help in implementing the feature

## <span id="understanding-the-project">‚ú® Understanding the Project</span>

Before contributing to the project, you need to understand the project structure and how it works. This section guides you through the project structure and how to run the project locally.

### <span id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</span>

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager. If you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed, this is how you can install pnpm globally:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

If you do not have Node.js installed, run the command:

```bash
npm install -g @pnpm/exe
```

> Note: For node 20.x upwards, some users have reported issues with pnpm. Check the [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation#compatibility) for more information, including other ways to install pnpm.

### <span id="project-structure">Project Structure</span>

The project uses a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) structure and is divided into three main folders:

1. `packages` - This folder contains all the packages used within the Million.js library
2. `test` - This folder contains all the tests written for the Million.js library
3. `website` - This folder contains the code for the website [Million.js](https://million.dev/)

#### 1. `packages` folder

The `packages` folder contains all the code related to the Million.js package, built using Typescript. The source code is divided into six main folders:

- `compiler` - This folder contains all the code related to the Million.js React compilers
- `jsx-runtime` - This folder contains the code related to the runtime code for jsx.
- `million` - This folder contains the code for the core Million.js package. The implementation of the optimized array rendering `<For/>`, `block()`, and virtual DOM for React are in here.
- `react` and `react-server` - This folder contains the Million.js support package for React
- `types` - This folder contains all the shared types between packages


#### 2. `test` folder

This folder contains the code for the tests for the implementation of core Million.js features like the "map-array" with `<For/>`, `block()`, and so on. The test uses the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

To run the test locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run test
```

#### 3. `website` folder

This folder contains the code for the Million.js website built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a framework that allows you to create static websites with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

The source code is divided into four main folders:

- `pages` - This folder contains all the website pages.
- `components` - This folder contains all the website components.
- `styles` - This folder contains all the styles of the website
- `public` - This folder contains all the website's static files.

> Note: To contribute to the website, you need to have a basic understanding of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and [MDX.](https://mdxjs.com/)

To run the website locally:
- Go to [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/) to create an account
- Get your API key and rename the `.env.example` to `.env` 
- Add the API key to the `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY`. 

Then, you'll need to install the dependencies and run the development server following the commands below: 

```bash
pnpm install
cd website  # Takes you to the website mono-repo
pnpm run dev
```

#### Gitpod

You can use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) to get a workspace configured to contribute on MillionJS. You only have to create a variable `MY_LIVEBLOCKS_KEY` on your [Gitpod profile](https://gitpod.io/user/variables) containing an API key on your Liveblocks account.

## <span id="contributing-to-the-project">üìù Contributing to the Project</span>

If you want to do more than report an issue or suggest an enhancement, you can contribute to the project by:

- cloning the repository (repo)
- making your changes
- opening a pull request

### <span id="cloning-the-repo">Cloning the Repository (repo)</span>

#### 1. Fork the repo

Click the fork button at the top right of the page to create a copy of this repo in your account, or go to the [Million.js fork page](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/fork).

After successfully forking the repo, you will be directed to your repo copy.

#### 2. Clone the forked repo

On your forked repo, click the green button that says `Code`. It will open a dropdown menu. Copy the link in the input with the label `HTTPS` or `GitHub CLI` depending on your preferred cloning mode.

For HTTPS, open up your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone <your-clone-link>
# or
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/million.git
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

You can also clone the repo using the GitHub CLI. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone <your-username>/million
```

#### 3. Set up the project

To set up the project, navigate into the project directory and open up the project in your preferred code editor.

```bash
cd million
code . # Opens up the project in VSCode
```

Install the dependencies using pnpm. You need to have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed; see the [prerequisite](#prerequisite) section.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### <span id="making-your-changes">Making your Changes</span>

#### 1. Create a new branch

Create a new branch from the `main` branch. Your branch name should be descriptive of the changes you are making. E.g., `docs-updating-the-readme-file`. Some ideas to get you started:

- For Feature Updates: `feat-<brief 2-4 words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- For Bug Fixes: `fix-<brief 2-4 words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- For Documentation: `docs-<brief 2-4 words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`

To create a new branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

#### 2. Run the project

The project is a mono repo containing the codes for the **website**, the **core Million.js package**, the **playground**, and the **tests**.

If you want to run the website locally, you need to `cd` into the website folder before running the development server:

```bash
cd website # Takes you to the website mono-repo
pnpm run dev
```

#### 3. Make your changes

You are to make only one contribution per pull request. It makes it easier to review and merge. If you have multiple bug fixes or features, create separate pull requests for each.

#### 4. Commit your changes

Your commit message should give a concise idea of the issue you are solving. It should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, as this helps us generate the project changelog automatically. A traditional structure of commit looks like so:

```bash
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

To commit your changes, run the following command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

Eg:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for Next.js"
```

#### 5. Clean up your code and push changes

After committing your changes, run the following command before pushing your local commits to the remote repository and ensure that all tests pass and there are no linting errors.

```bash
pnpm cleanup
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

Once all tests and linting pass, push your local commits to your remote repository.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### <span id="opening-a-pull-request">Opening a Pull Request(PR)</span>

#### 1. Create a new [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Go to the [Million.js repository](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/tree/main) and click the `compare & pull request` button or go to the [Pull Request page](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/pulls) and click on the `New pull request` button. It will take you to the `Open a pull request` page.

> Note: Make sure your PR points to the `main` branch, not any other one.

#### 2. Wait for review

üéâ Congratulations! You've made your pull request! A maintainer will review and merge your code or request changes. If changes are requested, make them and push them to your branch. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your branch and update.

## <span id="creating-a-dev-playground">üéÆ Creating A Development Playground</span>

If you are contributing to the Million.js package, you might want to test your changes in a controlled environment before applying them to the official Million.js package. This section guides you through creating a development playground for testing your changes.

### <span id="setting-up-a-development-environment">Setting Up A Development Environment</span>

To test your changes to the Million.js project on your computer, you must set up a development environment within an existing React project that uses Million.js as a dependency.

> Note: If you don't have an existing React project, you can create a new one using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Then install Million.js as a dependency using `npm install million`, `pnpm install million`, or `yarn add million`. If you already have the Million.js project cloned on your computer, you could also import it from your local file system as will be shown below.

Here's how to do it:

**1. Prepare Your Project**: Open the React or Next.js project you want to use as a playground for testing Million.js changes.

**2. Update Import Paths**: In your project's code, find the places where you import or want to Million.js components or functions. The imports might look something like this:

```jsx
import { block } from 'million/react';
```

**3. Switch to Absolute Paths**: Instead of using relative import paths (like 'million/react'), you'll change them to or use absolute paths that directly point to your local Million.js codebase on your computer. For example:

```jsx
import { block } from '/home/your-username/path-to-your-local-million/react';
```

Replace `/home/your-username/path-to-your-local-million/react` with the actual path to your Million.js codebase.

By doing this, you're effectively telling your project to use the local version of Million.js on your computer rather than the published version from npm. This way, you can test your changes in a controlled environment before applying them to the official Million.js package.

**4. Run Your Project**: Run your project and test your changes. If you make any changes to the Million.js codebase, you'll need to restart your project to see the changes.
