# `useList()`

**Syntax:** `const [list, delta] = useList(initialListValue)`\
**Example:** `const [list, delta] = useList([1, 2, 3])`

The `useList()` hook is an optimized version of the `useState()` hook, but exclusvely for arrays. Instead of returning `state` and `setState`, it returns `list` and `delta`. `list` is a mutable value that you can update like a variable, and `delta` is a payload that you can pass into virtual nodes.

```js {4,10,15}
import { createRoot, useList } from 'million/react';

function App() {
  const [list, delta] = useList([]);

  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          list.push(list.length + 1);
        }}
      >
        Add
      </button>
      <ul delta={delta}>
        {list.map((item) => (
          <li>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

createRoot(document.body).render(<App />);
```

`useList` leverages a highly reactive data structure and exports <Link href="/docs/api/advanced/delta">Delta</Link> to update the Virtual DOM. This makes it possible to update the DOM without having to go through traditional Virtual DOM diffing.

Below is a comparison chart of the insane performance `useList` (through Delta) has, making it as fast as [Solid.js](https://solidjs.com) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)!

React uses the Virtual DOM, and it can get **REALLY** slow when there's a lot of children, even with keyed nodes. The reason why is React isn't actually aware of the state during rendering, leading to a lot of unnecessary work.

> TL;DR: The bottleneck is diffing.

Million now supports a new Delta rendering, which is a new reactive primitive! It uses a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to capture changes to the state and calculate the necessary DOM manipulations.

This way, we bypass diffing altogether, removing the bottleneck:
