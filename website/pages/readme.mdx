# Readme

Million.js was initially created by [Aiden Bai](https://aiden.mov) in 2021 as a [research project](https://t.co/QR8JdGB9eb). Since then, it has grown into a community-driven project with over 40 contributors.

Our project's thesis is simple: **Developer Experience and User Experience are not mutually exclusive.** Frameworks should not only empower developers to build great products, but ship fast experiences for users.

In pursuit of this goal, we provide two main APIs:

- **"The Fundamentals"** - The underlying a [block virtual DOM](/blog/virtual-dom) API hyper-optimized for speed.
- **"The Growth Hack"** - The compatibility layer, which provides API's for React, Preact, Next.js, and more.

## Acknowledgments

Million takes heavy inspiration from the following projects:

- [`blockdom`](https://github.com/ged-odoo/blockdom) ([Géry Debongnie](https://github.com/ged-odoo))
  Thank you to Géry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.
- [`voby`](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) ([Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato))
  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
- [`bun`](https://bun.sh) for their homepage.
- [`react`](https://react.dev) and [`turbo`](https://turbo.build) for their documentation. Many parts of the current Million.js documentation are grokked and modified from theirs.
- [`ivi`](https://github.com/localvoid/ivi), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [and more](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2021/table_chrome_96.0.4664.45.html)

Million is being used at companies like [Wyze](https://wyze.com) and [Dimension](https://dimension.dev), as well as open source work like [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), [TinyPages](https://github.com/Borrus-sudo/tinypages), [and more](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/network/dependents).
